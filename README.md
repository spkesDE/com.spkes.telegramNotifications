# Telegram Notifications

This app adds support to send Telegram messages from and to your Homey Pro.


### How to setup

1. Install the app
2. Set up your own Telegram bot. This is fully secure and private, since you are the only one who can access the message archive. Enter @Botfather in the search tab of **Telegram** and choose the @Botfather bot.
3. Click “Start” to activate @BotFather bot or enter `/newbot`. I recommend to set the bot to private (aka `/setjoingroup` to DISABLED) and to set the privacy to DISABLED (Send `/setprivacy` to @BotFather)
4. Enter the Token inside the app settings
5. Write your bot over Telegram `/start` and follow the instructions
   Each user has to also send the Bot the `/start` command. You can share the Bot via Telegram over the profile or search for the like u searched for the BotFather bot.
